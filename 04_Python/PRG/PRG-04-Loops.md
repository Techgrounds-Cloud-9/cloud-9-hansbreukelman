# PRG-04-Loops
Become familiar with using Loops in Python and the difference between the two types of Loops. Where and what you can use them for.
#
## Key terminology
### For loop
A for loop is used for iterating over a sequence (that is either a list, a tuple, a dictionary, a set, or a string).

This is less like the for keyword in other programming languages, and works more like an iterator method as found in other object-orientated programming languages.

With the for loop we can execute a set of statements, once for each item in a list, tuple, set etc.

### While loop
With the while loop we can execute a set of statements as long as a condition is true.

### Range
The Python range() function returns a sequence of numbers, in a given range. The most common use of it is to iterate sequence on a sequence of numbers using Python loops.

### Array
An array is a collection of items stored at contiguous memory locations. The idea is to store multiple items of the same type together.
