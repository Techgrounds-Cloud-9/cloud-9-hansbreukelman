Python Conditions and If statements

## Key terminology
### Statements
Instructions written in the source code for execution are called statements. Python supports the usual logical conditions from mathematics. These conditions can be used in several ways, most commonly in "if statements" and loops.

### If statements
Python if statement is one of the most commonly used conditional statements in programming languages.

It decides whether certain statements need to be executed or not. It checks for a given condition, if the condition is true, then the set of code present inside the ” if ” block will be executed otherwise not.

### Input
