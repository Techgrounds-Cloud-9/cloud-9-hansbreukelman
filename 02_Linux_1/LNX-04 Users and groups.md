# LNX-04 Users and groups
Creating users and groups and all that comes with it.
#

## Key terminology

### Permissions
Linux being a multi-user system uses permissions and ownership for security.

### Sudo
Sudo stands for SuperUser DO and is used to access restricted files and operations.

### Admin group
The group is a collection of users using which one can reduce the administration task in the o/s environment.
#

## Exercise
- Create a new user that is part of a group, has a password and can use 'sudo'.
- Find the list containing the user.
