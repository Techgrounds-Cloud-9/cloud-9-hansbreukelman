### Overcome challenges
It took me too long. I definitely should have raised the alarm earlier, to make it a little easier on myself. In the end, I did resolve it myself, which is also kind of a good feeling. Next time I would like to ask for help a little earlier, or at least consult.  I had trouble connecting to the VM, but in the end I succeeded. The difference was in the order of the commands and there was probably a typo in the previous commands as well.

### Results
![After a long road of many tries and setbacks, it finally worked out.](https://github.com/Techgrounds-Cloud-9/cloud-9-hansbreukelman/blob/02c9ffcd7df70c92fd60589f96a2a96314010829/00_includes/LNX-01%20Setting%20Up.png)
