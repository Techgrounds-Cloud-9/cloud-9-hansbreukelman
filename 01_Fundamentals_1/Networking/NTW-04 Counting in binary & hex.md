# NTW-04 Counting in binary & hex
Studying and counting in Binary, Hexadecimal and Decimal.

## Key terminology
### Decimal
The decimal numeral system or ten-number system is a numeral system for representing numbers using the ten digits 0 through 9.

### Binary
The binary or bilinear number system is a positional system, in which a number is represented by a sequence of the digits 0 and 1.

### Hexadecimal
The hexadecimal number system is a number system with the base number 16. It is a positional system in which ten digits are not used, as is common in the decimal system, but sixteen digits. Hexadecimal literally means hexadecimal.

### Bits
The bit is the smallest unit of information, namely a symbol or signal that can take two values: on or off, yes or no, high or low, charged or uncharged. The binary number system represents these values by 1 and 0.

### Byte
A byte (symbol: B) is a binary unit of information, represented as a word of a contiguous sequence of bits. The de facto standard is that a byte consists of 8 bits.

### Overcome challenges
I took a good amount of time for this exercise to learn the calculus Binary, Hexadecimal and Decimal well. Because of this, I may have fallen a little behind my teammates, but did feel that I absorbed the material well.

### Results

### How to calculate decimal to binary
Decimal = 16 - 16 = 0

Smallest number from 16, so 16 - 16 = 0

     128 - 64 - 32 - 16 - 8 - 4 - 2 - 1
                      |   |   |   |   |
                Bin = 1   0   0   0   0

| Decimal | Binary |
| ---------------- | ---------------- |
| 16     | 10000    |
| 128    | 10000000|
|228 | 11100100|
|112 | 1110000|
|73| 1001001|

### How to calculate binary to decimal

Bin = 10101010

2/7 + 2/5 + 2/3 + 2/1 

128 + 32 + 8 + 2 = 170

| Bainary | Decimal |
| ---------------- | ---------------- |
|1010 1010|170|
|1111 0000|240|
|1101 1011|219|
|1010 0000|160|
|0011 1010|58|

### How to calculate decimal to hex
Decimal = 15

15 / 16 = 0,9375 = 0 R 
16 * 0,9375 = 15 remainder
0 R 15

15 = F = Hex

| Decimal | Hex |
| ---------------- | ---------------- |
|15|F
|37|25
|246|F6
|125|7D
|209|D1

### How to calculate hex to decimal
Hex = 88

8 -> 16/1  |  8 -> 16/0

128 + 8 = 136

| Hex | Decimal|
| ---------------- | ---------------- |
|88|136|
|e0|224
|cb|203
