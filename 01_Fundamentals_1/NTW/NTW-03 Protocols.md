# NTW-03 Protocols
[Give a short summary of the subject matter.]

## Key terminology
### Network protocol
A network protocol is regulations that define how things are sent between different devices on the same network.

### UDP
The User Datagram Protocol (UDP) is one of the basic protocols of the Internet. The protocol operates at the same level as TCP. UDP is considered unreliable: the protocol does not check that the data is actually sent properly and arrives in the same order, which is the case with TCP.

### ‘Fire and forget’ strategy
Fundamentally UDP is a fire and forget protocol. You send a data packet to a target, and that's that!

### ‘Three-way handshake’
A three-way handshake establishes a reliable connection between client and server, and is vital for online communication.
