# NTW-03 Protocols
[Give a short summary of the subject matter.]

## Key terminology
### Network protocol
A network protocol is regulations that define how things are sent between different devices on the same network.

### UDP
The User Datagram Protocol (UDP) is one of the basic protocols of the Internet. The protocol operates at the same level as TCP. UDP is considered unreliable: the protocol does not check that the data is actually sent properly and arrives in the same order, which is the case with TCP.

### ‘Fire and forget’ strategy
Fundamentally UDP is a fire and forget protocol. You send a data packet to a target, and that's that!

### ‘Three-way handshake’
A three-way handshake establishes a reliable connection between client and server, and is vital for online communication.

### HTTPS
Https in full stands for Hyper Text Transfer Protocol Secure and, like http, is a way to send data over the Internet. But then in a secure way.

### Wireshark
Wireshark is a network protocol analyzer, or an application that captures packets from a network connection, such as from your computer to your home office or the internet.

### QUIC
QUIC (Quick UDP Internet Connections) is een nieuw transportprotocol voor het internet, ontwikkeld door Google.

### Overcome challenges
[Give a short description of the challeges you encountered, and how you solved them.]

### Results
Identify other protocols and their connection to OSI layers.

### Understanding QUIC
What I understand from it is that QUIC is a protocol that is especially much associated with the use of Google Chrome. It is also realized by Google.

The QUIC protocol also constantly communicates with an ip address originating from Google.
