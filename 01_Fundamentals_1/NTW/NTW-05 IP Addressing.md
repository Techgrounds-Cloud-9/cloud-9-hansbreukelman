# NTW-05 IP Addressing
All about IP addresses and what's involved.
#

## Key terminology
### IP adress
An IP address is used to recognize a device connected to the Internet.

### Public IP
The public IP address is the IP address your router or modem is assigned by your Internet provider.

### Private IP
A private IP address is the IP address of the network your device is connected to. This IP address is assigned to your device by a router or other network device.

### IPv4
Internet Protocol version 4 (IPv4) is the fourth version of the Internet protocol. This version was first widely used and is the basis for addressing (the identification of computers) within the Internet.

### IPv6
Internet Protocol version 6 or IPv6 is version 6 of the Internet protocol for using IP addresses. It is the successor to Internet Protocol version 4 and is the second version of the Internet protocol to come into use.

### NAT
Network address translation (NAT, also called network masquerading or IP masquerading) is a collective term for techniques used in computer networks where the address information in the data packets is changed. 

### Static address
A static IP address is simply an address that doesn't change.

### Dynamic address
A dynamic IP address is an IP address that an internet provider lets you use temporarily.

The IP addresses are the same.
Think of your public IP as your home address. A public IP address visible on the internet is analogous to a street name and a building number that determine where you reside. A public IP address is how your router communicates with the World Wide Web. 
So that IP address is the same for every device.

### Private IP addresses phone and laptop

The IP addresses are very similar but not the same.
Every device connected to a network has a unique IP address through which the device can be recognized. This IP address depends on the modem being connected to. 

### Changing the private IP address of your mobile to that of your laptop
My phone keeps connecting to the router only it switches to mobile network instead of wifi. So it has no connection with the internet.

### Change the private IP address of your mobile to an address outside your network
I get the same as the previous question. keeps connecting to the router only it switches to mobile network instead of wifi. So it has no connection with the internet.
