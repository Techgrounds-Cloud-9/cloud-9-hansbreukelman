# SEC-03 IAM
Know all about authentication and authorization and what it can contribute to better security.

## Key terminology
### Authentication
Authentication is actually a process of verification, verifying someone or something. Examining the authenticity or correctness (of something or someone), verifying that someone is who they claim to be in order to then grant access, for example. This is about 'Who?'

### Authorization
Authorization is granting permission (a power) to an authenticated party to access a particular service or permission to perform a particular action. An authorization can be defined in access rights. This is about 'What?'

### MFA
Kort samengevat is Multi-Factor Authenticatie (MFA) een authenticatie methode waarbij de online gebruiker twee stappen succesvol moet doorlopen om ergens toegang tot te krijgen. Dit soort authenticatie wordt ook wel Two-Factor Authenticatie (2FA) genoemd.

## Exercise
Studying authentication and authorization and the difference between these and everything related to them.

### Overcome challenges

## Results
### The difference between authentication and authorization.

With authorization, the person is already authenticated, that means, he or she has already been examined and recognized, The person is authenticated. Authorization looks at what rights and privileges the authenticated person has or will have. As an example: The person already has access to the database because he or she is already authenticated, authorization looks at what particular data this person has access to in the database.

### The three factors of authentication are:
1. Something you know! For example, a password.
2. Something you have! For example, a smart card.
3. Something you are! For example, a fingerprint.
#

### Multi-Factor Authenticatie
By applying Multi-Factor Authentication, multiple ways are used to verify that the person is who they say they are. This increases security. Multiple things are then needed as proof to verify the person, this could be a security question associated with the person in addition to a password. This goes hand in hand with the three factors of authentication above. In addition, location and time can also play a role.

### The principle of least privilege:

 Minimizes the attack surface, reducing the paths a culprit can use to access sensitive data or launch an attack by protecting superuser and administrator privileges. Reduces the spread of malware by not allowing users to install unauthorized applications.
