Hashing is usually used to ensure the integrity of data, primarily when weâ€™re storing large amounts of it, while encryption is aimed more at protecting the privacy of small amounts of data while in transit;

Hashing is one-way, while encryption is two-way. Encryption turns plain text into ciphertext, which is unreadable, but you can decrypt it with a relevant key. Hashing scrambles a plain text into a unique encoded hash unit, which can't be reverted into a readable form.
