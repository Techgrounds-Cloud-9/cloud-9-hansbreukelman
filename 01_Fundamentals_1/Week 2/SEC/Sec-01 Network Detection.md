# Sec-01 Network Detection
Learning to use different programs/tools to analyze my network.

## Key terminology
### Nmap
This program scans the network to which a computer is connected and lists ports, device names, operating systems and various other detectable hosts that show the user their connection status and function. Nmap can be used for hacking, by gettin access to uncontrolled ports on a system.

### Wireshark
Wireshark is a network protocol analyzer, or an application that captures packets from a network connection, such as from your computer to your home office or the internet.

## Exercise
Studying and applying Nmap and Wireshark in combination with Linux.

### Overcome challenges
A fun assignment. I found researching Nmap very interesting and definitely want to delve more into it.

## Results
Installing Nmap and scanning the network of Linux machine.
