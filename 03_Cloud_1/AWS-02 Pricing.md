Everything about AWS pricing models

## Key terminology
### Free-tier
The Free Tier is comprised of three different types of offerings, a 12-month Free Tier, an Always Free offer, and short term trials. Services with a 12-month Free Tier allow customers to use the product for free up to specified limits for one year from the date the account was activated.

### Overcome challenges
#
## Results
### Pay-as-you-go
AWS has pay-as-you-go method for pricing a large number of its cloud services. With AWS, you then pay only for the individual services you need for as long as you use them, and without long contracts or difficult licensing.

### Save when you commit
'Save when you commit' or 'Savings Plans' is a flexible method that allows you to save quite a bit on AWS usage. The pricing model offers lower prices for AWS Compute and AWS Machine Learning. Savings Plans offer savings over On-Demand in exchange for a commitment to use a specific amount of an AWS service or category of services, for a period of one or three years.

### Pay less by using more
With AWS you can get discounts based on your amount of usage or increase in usage. So the more you use the more discount. For services like S3 and data transfer OUT from EC2, pricing is tiered, meaning the more you use, the less you pay per GB. In addition, data transfer IN is always free. You only pay for outbound. So as your AWS usage needs increase, you benefit from economies of scale that allow you to increase usage and control costs.

### Benefit from massive economies of scale
By using cloud computing, you can achieve lower flexible costs than on your own. Because the usage of hundreds of thousands of customers is aggregated in the cloud, providers such as AWS can achieve higher economies of scale, which translates into lower pay as you go prices.

### Capex
Capex stands for Capital Expenditures. 
It refers to the cost of developing or delivering non-consumable parts of a product or system (investment).. As an example: A purchase of a printer is a "Capex" expenditure, the toner and paper used for it are the Opex expenditure.

### Opex
Operating Expenditures (OPEX), or Operating Expenses, are the fixed costs incurred by the business. They are the recurring costs incurred in the business to keep it operating. Examples of OPEX are: Personnel costs, Rent, Office supplies, etc.
