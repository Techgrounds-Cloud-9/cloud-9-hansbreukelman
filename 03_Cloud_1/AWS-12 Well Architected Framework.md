### Overcome challenges
[Give a short description of the challeges you encountered, and how you solved them.]

## Results

### **The six pillars**
#

### **Operational Excellence pillar**
- Support development and run workloads effectively
- Gain insights into workloads operations
- Continiously improve processes and procedures to deliver buisness value

Best practices for operational excellence:
- Preform operations as code
- Make frequent, small, reverseable changes
- Refine operations frequently
- Anticipate failure
- Learn from all operational failure

#

### **Security pillar**
Protect data, sytems, and assetsto take advantage of cloud technologies to improve your security
  
Best practices for security:
- Implement a strong identity foundation
- Enable tracability
- Apply security at all layers
- Automatic security best practices
- Protect data in transit and at rest
- Keep people away from data
- Prepare for security event
#
### **Reliability pillar**
- Ensuring a workload can preform it's intended function correctly and constantly when it's expected to.
- This includes the ability to operate and test the workload trough it's lifecycle

Best practices for reliability:
- Automatically recover from failure
- Test recovery procedures
- Scale horizontally to increase aggregate workload availability
- Stop guessing capacity
- Manage change in automation

#
### **Preformance efficiency pillar**
The abillity to use computing resources efficiently to meet system requirements and to maintain that efficiency as demand changes and technologiesevolve

Best practices for preformance efficiency:
- Democratize advanced technologies
- Go global in minutes
- Use serverless architectures
- Experiment more often
- Consider mechanical sympathy

#
### **Cost optimization pillar**
The ability to run systems to deliver buisness value at the lowest pricepoint

Best practices for cost optimization:
- Implement cloud financial management
- Adopt a consumption model
- Measure overall efficiency
- Stop spending money on undifferentiated heavy lifting
- Analyze and attribute expenditure

#
### **Sustainability pillar**
The discipline of sustainability addresses the long-term environmental, economic, and societal impact of your business activities.

Best practices for sustainability:
- Understand your impact
- Establish sustainability goals
- Maximize utilization
- Anticipate and adopt new, more efficient hardware and software offerings
- Use managed services
- Reduce the downstream impact of your cloud workloads
