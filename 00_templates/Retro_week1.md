## What went well?
- Finished all the assignmensts
- Sprinterviews went well. 
  Putting together the sprint interview was quick, the presentation was put together quickly. Despite the speed, the information was good and solid.
- Help to each other went well and even to members of other teams. At times it was quite crowded in our breakout room.

## What could have gone better?
- Stand up could gone better
  Sometimes skipped the standup a few times.
- The Azure delay was disturbing though
- Some were a little too lax in reading all the information, these want to improve reading in the next week.
